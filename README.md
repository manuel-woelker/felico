A fun, hobby programming language experiment

This is an experimental programming language project,
mostly inspired by Rust and Zig,
mostly intended to try out some ideas about programming language design.

## Goals

In order:

### 1. Fun

Programming should be fun.

Both using and creating the language and infrastructure should be fun.
Fun comes in all shapes and sizes: it may be humour, whimsy, a challenging problem to solve or a job well done.

### 2. Friendly

Programming should be friendly.

The language, as well as its ecosystem and community should be friendly.
This means welcoming of new ideas, mutual understanding and assuming good intentions.
We all make mistakes, and that is ok.

A friendly environment is fun to work in, which neatly ties into the first goal.

### 3. Fast

Programming should be fast.
Fast feedback loops are essential for a fun development environment.
This holds for the actual writing of code as well as compilation, test and execution times.

Fast feedback loops are more fun, and more friendly to me as a user since they respect my time.

## Desired features

* Static typing
* Light-weight effect type system

## Undesired features

* Exceptions
* Garbage collection
